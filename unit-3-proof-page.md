# Unit 3: Proof Page

## Objective
Make trust visible. Show that participation results in verifiable regeneration activity.

## Page Goal (v1)
Single public page with:
1. Live or daily-updated impact totals.
2. Recent certificates and transaction references.
3. A clear verification path.

## Required Sections
1. Impact Counter
- Total credits retired
- Total retirements
- Latest update timestamp

2. Recent Proof Feed
- Last 10 retirement entries with:
  - Date
  - Credit/project reference
  - Retirement/certificate ID
  - Transaction hash or link

3. Verification Guide
- `How to verify a retirement in under 60 seconds`
- Links to explorer/indexer/certificate pages

4. Method Note
- Clarify this is regenerative contribution tracking.
- Avoid "carbon neutral" claims unless legally reviewed.
