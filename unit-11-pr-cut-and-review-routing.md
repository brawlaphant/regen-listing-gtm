# Unit 11: PR Cut and Review Routing

## Objective
Open a targeted PR that a busy technical lead can approve with minimal friction.

## PR Positioning
Use a listing-specific title and body:
- Title/body source:
  `docs/listing-gtm/PR_DRAFT_COINSTORE_GTM.md`

## Required Review Assignments
1. Primary technical reviewer (e.g., bridge.eco or Regen R&D).
2. Secondary fallback reviewer.
3. Final publisher.

## Execution Steps
1. Create branch with `codex/` prefix.
2. Commit GTM stack changes.
3. Open PR using draft title/body.
4. Request review from primary + fallback.
5. Post PR link in team Telegram with ask:
   `Need technical signoff for listing deployment path.`

## Owner Matrix
- DRI: ASSIGNED_RELEASE_OWNER
- Approver: ASSIGNED_RELEASE_OWNER
- Publisher: ASSIGNED_RELEASE_OWNER
- Fallback Publisher: ASSIGNED_RELEASE_OWNER
- Target Time (UTC): T0-8h

## Definition of Done
1. PR opened with listing-targeted title.
2. Reviewer assignments are explicit.
3. Merge/publish owner is identified in PR context block.
