## Posting Cadence (14-day campaign)
1. One daily campaign status update
2. One daily proof highlight
3. One daily FAQ or education post
4. One reminder before day close

## Content Types
1. `Status`: where campaign stands
2. `Proof`: real certificate or tx evidence
3. `Action`: exact next step users should take
