# Contributing

## Branching
- Use short branch names tied to one scope.
- Keep PRs focused and small enough for fast review.

## Before opening a PR
1. Run `npm run gtm:preflight`.
2. If preparing for publish, run `npm run gtm:preflight:strict`.
3. Update affected docs/templates and include rollout notes.

## Review expectations
- Include risk level and rollback notes in the PR template.
- Request review from the Regen owner/team listed in `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
