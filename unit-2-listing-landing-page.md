# Unit 2: Listing Landing Page

## Objective
Convert exchange listing traffic into long-term aligned holders who take the next step:

`Buy -> Participate -> Proof`

Secondary path:

`Opt in as non-holder supporter -> Participate -> Proof`

## Page Goal (v1)
One page that answers:
1. Why this token exists.
2. Why someone should stay involved after buying.
3. What action to take next.

## Required Sections
1. Hero
- Headline: `AI usage funds verified ecological regeneration.`
- Subhead: `Every retirement is on-chain and publicly verifiable.`
- CTA buttons:
  - `Trade on Coinstore`
  - `See Live Proof`
  - `Join Telegram`

2. Why Hold (utility, not price promises)
- Access to participation campaigns.
- Priority access to product/community programs.
- Public attribution to impact actions.

3. How It Works
- `Buy token`
- `Participate in regeneration action`
- `Verify proof on-chain`

4. Trust + Safety
- No investment return promises.
- Transparent methodology and verification links.
- Clear risk and disclosure language.

5. FAQ (short)
- What is this token used for?
- How is impact verified?
- Is this a financial product?
- Where can I track retirements?
